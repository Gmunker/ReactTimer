React Timer Application

You can follow my live progress at: http://gmunker-reacttimer.herokuapp.com/#/?_k=geraff

I am making this project from the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/, which I highly recommend to anyone looking to learn ReactJS. @andrew_j_mead has a great way of teaching.

Things I learned in this project included everything from the reactWeather app located in my GitHub, with the addition of lifecycle events, and testing my components.

Testing tools include: Karama, Mocha, and Expect. 

Thanks for checking out my app, and progress, there will be more coming soon, as I continue the course and do many more.
