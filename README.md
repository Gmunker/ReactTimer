React Timer Application

You can follow my live progress at: 

I am making this project from the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/, which I highly recommend to anyone looking to learn ReactJS. @AndrewMead has a great way of teaching.

Thanks for checking out my app, and progress, there will be more coming soon, as I continue the course and do many more.
